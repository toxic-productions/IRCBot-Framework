the IRCBot-Framework by Toxic-Productions is a simple-to-use and easy to setup framework for PHP bots. It is currently in alpha and is being tested on irc.x10hosting.com:6667/#paidhosting.

The framework currently only has one type of bot and no web GUI. But as we progress, we will have bot items like Gaming bots, news bots, information bots and a whole load more.

We request that you open an issue if you find a bug or want to request a feature. Also, feel free to send us pull requests. The chances are, we'll accept them.
